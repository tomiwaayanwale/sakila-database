# Sakila Database Project

## Overview

This project involves working with the Sakila database, a popular sample database provided by MySQL. The project aims to explore and visualize the data within the Sakila database, providing insights into various aspects of a fictional video rental store, such as customer behavior, rental patterns, and inventory management.

## Objectives

- Database Exploration:Understand the schema and relationships within the Sakila database.
- Data Extraction: Query the database to extract meaningful information.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations to represent key metrics and trends within the data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Exploration

- Schema Understanding: Explore the structure of the Sakila database, including tables like `film`, `rental`, `customer`, `inventory`, and `payment`.
- Entity Relationships: Analyze the relationships between entities (e.g., the link between customers and rentals, films and inventory).

### 2. Data Extraction

- SQL Queries: Write and execute SQL queries to extract data from the Sakila database. Some examples include:
  - Finding the most popular movies based on rental data.
  - Analyzing rental trends over time.
  - Identifying top customers by rental activity.
- Data Aggregation: Aggregate data to derive metrics such as average rental duration, total revenue generated, and customer retention rates.

### 3. Data Visualization

- Bar Charts: Visualize the most rented films and busiest stores.
- Line Graphs: Show trends in rentals over time, highlighting peak periods.
- Pie Charts: Display the distribution of customers across different cities or the proportion of movies rented by genre.
- Heatmaps: Visualize correlations between various factors like rental duration and film length.

## Tools and Technologies

- MySQL: For database management and querying.
- power bi:** For data manipulation and visualization.

## How to Run

1. Set Up Sakila Database

## Results

The analysis and visualizations generated from the Sakila database provide valuable insights into:

- Rental Patterns: Understanding peak rental times, popular films, and customer preferences.
- Store Performance: Identifying the most and least successful stores.
- Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on rental history and other factors.

## Conclusion

The insights from the Sakila database help in understanding the operations of a video rental business. This project demonstrates how database management, data extraction, and visualization can be combined to derive actionable business insights.
